# --- Intelligent Routing Configuration ---
# The proxy now uses an intelligent router to select the best model based on the request.
# You can configure the router to use your preferred models for different tasks.
# Model names should be prefixed with provider: anthropic/, openai/, gemini/, or custom/.

# Model for background tasks (e.g., claude-3-haiku)
ROUTER_BACKGROUND="custom/deepseek-v3-250324"

# Model for complex reasoning and "thinking" tasks
ROUTER_THINK="custom/deepseek-r1-250528"

# Model for handling very long context windows
ROUTER_LONG_CONTEXT="custom/gemini-2.5-pro"

# Default model for general tasks (e.g., claude-3-sonnet)
ROUTER_DEFAULT="custom/deepseek-v3-250324"

# Token count threshold to trigger the long-context model
LONG_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD="32000"
