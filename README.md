# Anthropic API Proxy for Claude Code üîÑ

A proxy server that translates Anthropic API requests to multiple model providers (OpenAI, Gemini, custom) using native OpenAI SDK. This allows you to use Claude Code with a wide range of OpenAI-compatible models.

## Primary Use Case: Claude Code Proxy

The main purpose of this project is to serve as a proxy for **Claude Code**, enabling it to connect to and utilize third-party models that follow the OpenAI API format. This extends the power of Claude Code beyond its native models.

### Recommended Usage Strategy

**1. Primary Choice: Official Claude Models**

If you have a Claude Pro subscription or API access, it is highly recommended to use the official Anthropic models as your default choice. This ensures the best performance, latest features, and full compatibility.

**2. Fallback/Alternative: This Proxy**

Use this proxy in the following scenarios:
- When your official Claude API quota has been exhausted.
- As a cost-effective alternative for less critical tasks.
- To experiment with different models while maintaining the Claude Code workflow.
